This application is an exercise for the FIS laboratory. You can find the lab assignment on the [lab web page](http://labs.cs.upt.ro/~oose/pmwiki.php/FSE/LAB2019).



## Java Spring

>Spring Framework is a Java platform that provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications. Spring handles the infrastructure so you can focus on your application.

>Spring enables you to build applications from “plain old Java objects” (POJOs) and to apply enterprise services non-invasively to POJOs. This capability applies to the Java SE programming model and to full and partial Java EE.
